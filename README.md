# BUZZ BANK WEB APP (WIP)

This a web bank based on frontend technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). It is based on frontend alone, so users will lose progress if browser is refreshed.

## Features

- Create account and Login (However, progress is lost after being refreshed).

- Locally stored accounts for users to interact with

- Transfer to any accounts created or available on the platform

- Loan credited to account

- Funny alert when balance is less than certain amount

- Responsive and adapts to screen of every sizes

- Checks for error when creating or logging in (If account details already exists)

- Login and switch between hard coded accounts to see implemented functions (money transferred and others)

- Settings menu

### NOTE

This is not a real bank app, it is just a prototype and a practice project, any changes made will not be reflected in actuality.

Use only in-app navigations as this is a Single Page Application
